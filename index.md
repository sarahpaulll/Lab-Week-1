## Projects
### 1. Surveillance Outages and Flight Delays
I analyzed flight data over 14 years in 15 minute bins across 77 airports. Designed a multiple linear regression model and statistical t-tests to predict airplane delays
### 2. Death Penalty and Homicide Rates
I gathered relevant data, clean and wrangled the datasets. Then ran different statistical tests to see the relationship between homicide rates and abolishing/halting the death penalty.
